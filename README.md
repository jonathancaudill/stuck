# stuck - a better mac notes app.

The macos notes apps are looking a little worse for wear these days. For years, I've wanted an easy-to-use macOS notes app that had pin-on-top easily and immediately accesible. One whose windows could be made tiny. One that didn't look hideous (stickies <3). Stuck is my attempt at just that.

### Note: As it's still in early development/use as a personal project, stuck will not automatically check for updates. You'll need to download updates from the release page for now. 

### It's also a little bit buggy still, so if you're using it and encounter something, feel free to submit an issue, and check back here to see if it's been fixed ðŸ™‚
