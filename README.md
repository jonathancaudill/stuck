# stuck - a better mac notes app.

The macos notes apps are looking a little worse for wear these days. For years, I've wanted an easy-to-use macOS notes app that had pin-on-top easily and immediately accesible. One whose windows could be made tiny. One that didn't look hideous (stickies <3). stuck is my attempt at just that. It's got a ways to go still (if you delete a note, it's gone forever at the moment), but it's getting better. Looks best in dark mode.

## building
